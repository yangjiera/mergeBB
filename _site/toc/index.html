The rapid rise of mobile computing, combined with wearable sensors, and an increasingly connected IoT world, has begun to shift the potential for personalisation, from the virtual world of the web, to the physical world in which we live, work, and play.

One method for energy saving in commercial buildings targets inefficiencies of unoccupied spaces by relaxing the setpoint temperature. However, energy savings are severely limited when occupants are assumed to be "immovable objects"; instead, by encouraging occupant participation in the optimization, a much greater amount of energy savings can be achieved. In this work, we build on this idea and introduce energy saving recommendations based on occupant location. We introduce two types of energy saving recommendations based on location: move recommendations, which recommends the occupant to move from one space to another, and shift schedule recommendations, which recommends the occupant to arrive or depart a set amount of time earlier or later. To investigate the effects of the energy saving recommendations, we introduced a tightly coupled system composing of a simulator and a recommender system. Simulations in our building testbed revealed that energy saving recommendations coupled with occupancy-based HVAC energy management saves 25% more energy than occupancy-based HVAC energy management alone.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653187" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">PACELA: A Neural Framework for User Visitation in Location-based Social Networks</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Thanh-Nam Doan</li> <li class="nameList Last">Ee-Peng Lim</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Check-in prediction using location-based social network data is an important research problem for both academia and industry since an accurate check-in predictive model is useful to many applications, e.g. urban planning, venue recommendation, route suggestion, and context-aware advertising. Intuitively, when considering venues to visit, users may rely on their past observed visit histories as well as some latent attributes associated with the venues. In this paper, we therefore propose a check-in prediction model based on a neural framework called Preference and Context Embeddings with Latent Attributes (PACELA). PACELA learns the embeddings space for the user and venue data as well as the latent attributes of both users and venues. More specifically, we use a probabilistic matrix factorization-based technique to infer the latent attributes specific to users and locations in location-based social networks (LBSNs), considering the user visitation decisions that could be affected by area attraction, neighborhood competition, and social homophily. PACELA also includes a deep learning neural network to combine both embedding and latent features to predict if a user performs check-in on a location. Our experiments on three different real world datasets show that PACELA yields the best check-in prediction accuracy against several baseline methods.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653188" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">ReEL: R eview Aware Explanation of Location Recommendation</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Ramesh Baral</li> <li class="nameList">XiaoLong Zhu</li> <li class="nameList">S.

Unlike ratings, the reviews can help users to elaborate their consumption experience in terms of relevant factors of interest (aspects). Though some of the existing systems have exploited user reviews, most of them are less transparent and non-interpretable (as they conceal the reason behind recommendation). These reasons have motivated us towards explainable and interpretable recommendation. To the best of our knowledge, only a few of the researchers have exploited user reviews to incorporate the sentiment and opinions on different aspects for personalized and explainable POI recommendation. This paper proposes a model termed as ReEL (Review aware Explanation of Location Recommendation) which models the review-aspect correlation by exploiting deep neural network, formulates user-aspect bipartite relation as a bipartite graph, and models the explainable recommendation by using dense subgraph extraction and ranking-based techniques. The major contributions of this paper are: (i) it models users and POIs using the aspects posted on user reviews, and it provisions incorporation of multiple contexts (e.g., categorical, spatial, etc.) in POI recommendation, (ii) it formulates preference of users' on aspects as a bipartite relation, represents it as a location-aspect bipartite graph, and models the explainable recommendation with the notion of ordered dense subgraph extraction using bipartite cores, shingles, and ranking-based techniques, and (iii) it extensively evaluates the proposed models using three real-world datasets and demonstrates an improvement of 5.8% to 29.5% on F-score metric, when compared to the relevant studies.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653189" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">A Framework for Interaction-driven User Modeling of Mobile News Reading Behaviour</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Marios Constantinides</li> <li class="nameList Last">John Dowell</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>The news you read is, of course, a highly individual choice and one for which substantial and successful news recommendation techniques have been developed. But as well as what news you read, the way you choose and read that news is also known to be highly individual. We propose a framework for extending the user profile of news readers with features of these interactions. The extensions are dynamic through monitoring an individual's reading and browsing activity. They include factors learned from the user's interaction log and also factors inferred from category level definitions contained in the framework. We report a study in which users' interaction logs with a news app are used to generate user profiles that are verified with self-reported questionnaire data about reading habits. We discuss the implications of our user modeling approach in news personalisation for both recommendation and user interface personalisation for news apps.</p></div> </div> <h2>SESSION: Technology-Enhanced Adaptive Learning I</h2> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList Last">Judy Kay</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653180" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Improving Learning &#38; Reducing Time: A Constrained Action-Based Reinforcement Learning Approach</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Shitian Shen</li> <li class="nameList">Markel Sanz Ausin</li> <li class="nameList">Behrooz Mostafavi</li> <li class="nameList Last">Min Chi</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Constrained action-based decision-making is one of the most challenging decision-making problems. It refers to a scenario where an agent takes action in an environment not only to maximize the expected cumulative reward but where it is subject to certain action-based constraints; for example, an upper limit on the total number of certain actions being carried out. In this work, we construct a general data-driven framework called Constrained Action-based Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (CAPOMDP) to induce effective pedagogical policies. Specifically, we induce two types of policies: CAPOMDP<sub>LG</sub> using learning gain as reward with the goal of improving students' learning performance, and CAPOMDP<sub>Time</sub> using time as reward for reducing students' time on task. The effectiveness of CAPOMDP<sub>LG</sub> is compared against a random yet reasonable policy and the effectiveness of CAPOMDP<sub>Time</sub> is compared against both a Deep Reinforcement Learning induced policy and a random policy. Empirical results show that there is an Aptitude-Treatment Interaction effect: students are split into High vs. Low based on their incoming competence; while no significant difference is found among the High incoming competence groups, for the Low groups, students following CAPOMDP<sub>Time</sub> indeed spent significantly less time than those using the two baseline policies and students following CAPOMDP<sub>LG</sub> significantly outperform their peers on both learning gain and learning efficiency.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653181" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">A Fine-Grained Open Learner Model for an Introductory Programming Course</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Jordan Barria-Pineda</li> <li class="nameList">Julio Guerra-Hollstein</li> <li class="nameList Last">Peter Brusilovsky</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Guiding students to the learning activities that are most appropriate for their current level of knowledge is one of the goals that adaptive educational systems tried to achieve during the last decades. Recently, several attempts have been made to use Open Learner Models (OLM) as a tool for achieving this goal. While the original goal of OLM is to help students reflect about their own learning process, extending OLM with navigation support functionality enables students to take immediate actions towards improving their knowledge. In this work, we attempted to extend the navigation support functionality of OLM by developing a fine-grained OLM that offers student knowledge visualization on both topic and concept levels. The fine-grained OLM enables students to directly explore connections between their knowledge and available learning activities, making an informed decision about their next learning steps. To assess the impact of the new type of OLM, we evaluated several versions of it in a classroom study, while also comparing it with data from our earlier studies that featured a coarse-grained OLM. Our results suggest that the fine-grained OLM considerably impacts student choice of learning activities, making student learning more efficient. We also found that the specific design features of fine-grained OLM could affect students' confidence and persistence while selecting and attempting the learning activities.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653182" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Gaze-Enhanced Student Modeling for Game-based Learning</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Andrew Emerson</li> <li class="nameList">Robert Sawyer</li> <li class="nameList">Roger Azevedo</li> <li class="nameList Last">James Lester</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Recent advances in eye-tracking technologies have introduced the opportunity to incorporate gaze into student modeling.

This paper introduces a gaze-enhanced student modeling framework that incorporates student eye tracking to dynamically predict students' performance in a game-based learning environment for microbiology education, CRYSTAL ISLAND. The gaze-enhanced student modeling framework was investigated in a study comparing a gaze-enhanced student model with a baseline student model that does not utilize student eye-tracking. Results of a study conducted with 65 college students interacting with the CRYSTAL ISLAND game-based learning environment indicate that the gaze-enhanced student model significantly outperforms the baseline model in dynamically predicting student problem-solving performance. The findings suggest that incorporating gaze into student modeling can contribute to a new generation of student models for game-based learning environments.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653183" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Co-embeddings for Student Modeling in Virtual Learning Environments</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Milagro Teruel</li> <li class="nameList Last">Laura Alonso Alemany</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>We present a neural architecture to model student behavior in virtual educational environments using purely unsupervised information. A crucial part of this architecture is the optimization of a joint embedding function to represent both students and course elements into a single shared space. This joint representation is more adequate than disjoint representations because it elicits insights on the relations between students and contents. Moreover, the model is trained only with interactions of the student with online learning platforms, without requiring any additional manual labeling by experts. We obtain state-of-the-art results using this approach in two types of task: first, dropout prediction in online courses (MOOCs), and second Knowledge Tracing in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). We explore how the deep architecture is flexible enough to capture variables related to different phenomena, such as engagement or skill mastery.</p></div> </div> <h2>SESSION: Personalized Recommender Systems II</h2> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList Last">Dietmar Jannach</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653184" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Intent-aware Item-based Collaborative Filtering for Personalised Diversification</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Jacek Wasilewski</li> <li class="nameList Last">Neil Hurley</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Diversity has been identified as one of the key dimensions of recommendation utility that should be considered besides the overall accuracy of the system. A common diversification approach is to rerank results produced by a baseline recommendation engine according to a diversification criterion. The intent-aware framework is one of the frameworks that has been proposed for recommendations diversification. It assumes existence of a set of aspects associated with items, which also represent user intentions, and the framework promotes diversity across the aspects to address user expectations more accurately. In this paper we consider item-based collaborative filtering and suggest that the traditional view of item similarity is lacking a user perspective. We argue that user preferences towards different aspects should be reflected in recommendations produced by the system. We incorporate the intent-aware framework into the item-based recommendation algorithm by injecting personalised intent-aware covariance into the item similarity measure, and explore the impact of such change on the performance of the algorithm. Our experiments show that the proposed method improves both accuracy and diversity of recommendations, offering better accuracy/diversity tradeoff than existing solutions.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653195" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Collaborative Filtering with Behavioral Models</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Dusan Sovilj</li> <li class="nameList">Scott Sanner</li> <li class="nameList">Harold Soh</li> <li class="nameList Last">Hanze Li</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Collaborative filtering (CF) has made it possible to build personalized recommendation models leveraging the collective data of large user groups, albeit with prescribed models that cannot easily leverage the existence of known behavioral models in particular settings. In this paper, we facilitate the combination of CF with existing behavioral models by introducing Bayesian Behavioral Collaborative Filtering (BBCF). BBCF works by embedding arbitrary (black-box) probabilistic models of human behavior in a latent variable Bayesian framework capable of collectively leveraging behavioral models trained on all users for personalized recommendation. There are three key advantages of BBCF compared to traditional CF and non-CF methods: (1) BBCF can leverage highly specialized behavioral models for specific CF use cases that may outperform existing generic models used in standard CF, (2) the behavioral models used in BBCF may offer enhanced intepretability and explainability compared to generic CF methods, and (3) compared to non-CF methods that would train a behavioral model per specific user and thus may suffer when individual user data is limited, BBCF leverages the data of all users thus enabling strong performance across the data availability spectrum including the near cold-start case. Experimentally, we compare BBCF to individual and global behavioral models as well as CF techniques; our evaluation domains span sequential and non-sequential tasks with a range of behavioral models for individual users, tasks, or goal-oriented behavior. Our results demonstrate that BBCF is competitive if not better than existing methods while still offering the interpretability and explainability benefits intrinsic to many behavioral models.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653196" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Controlling Spotify Recommendations: Effects of Personal Characteristics on Music Recommender User Interfaces</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Martijn Millecamp</li> <li class="nameList">Nyi Nyi Htun</li> <li class="nameList">Yucheng Jin</li> <li class="nameList Last">Katrien Verbert</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>The "black box'' nature of today's recommender systems raises a number of challenges for users, including a lack of trust and limited user control. Providing more user control is interesting to enable end-users to help steer the recommendation process with additional input and feedback. However, different users may have different preferences with regard to such control. To the best of our knowledge, no research has investigated the effect of personal characteristics on visual control techniques in the music recommendation domain. In this paper, we present results of a user study on the web using two different visualisation techniques (a radar chart and sliders) that allows users to control Spotify recommendations. A within-subject design with<i>Latin Square</i> counterbalancing measures was used for the study. Results indicate that the radar chart helped the participants discover a significantly higher number of new songs compared to the sliders. We also found that users' experience with Spotify had an influence on their interaction with different musical attributes. The participants who used Spotify frequently and users with a high individual musical sophistication interacted with the attributes significantly more with the radar chart compared to the sliders. Individual musical sophistication also had a significant impact on their interaction with the interaction techniques. The participants with high musical sophistication interacted significantly more with the radar chart in comparison to the sliders. Based on the feedback from our participants, we provide design suggestions to further improve user control in music recommendation.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653197" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Incorporating Constraints into Matrix Factorization for Clothes Package Recommendation</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Agung Toto Wibowo</li> <li class="nameList">Advaith Siddharthan</li> <li class="nameList">Judith Masthoff</li> <li class="nameList Last">Chenghua Lin</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Recommender systems have been widely applied in the literature to suggest individual items to users.

The novelty in this work is that we combined matrix factorisation methods for collaborative filtering with hand-crafted and learnt fashion constraints on combining item features such as colour, formality and patterns. Finally, to better understand where the algorithms are underperforming, we conducted focus groups, which lead to deeper insights into how to use constraints to improve package recommendation in this domain.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653198" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">How to Use Social Relationships in Group Recommenders: Empirical Evidence</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Amra Delic</li> <li class="nameList">Judith Masthoff</li> <li class="nameList">Julia Neidhardt</li> <li class="nameList Last">Hannes Werthner</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>In this paper we present the results of a user study focusing on social relationships within small groups.

However, socially central group members and socially close groups are significantly happier with group decisions than those who are loosely related. Moreover, in this paper we show that social relationships are indicators of other concepts relevant in group settings, therefore in group recommender systems as well.</p></div> </div> <h2>SESSION: Technology-Enhanced Adaptive Learning II</h2> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList Last">Olga C.

In this environment, students learn science topics by building causal models. Our analyses combine observational data on student affect to log files of students' interactions within the OELE. Preliminary analyses show that two relatively infrequent affective states, boredom and delight, show especially marked differences among high and low performing students. Further analysis shows that many of these differences occur after receiving feedback from the virtual agents in the Betty's Brain environment.

We explore how to do this for an OLM based on fine-grained long term physical activity tracker data that many people are accumulating. We aim to tackle two well-documented challenges that people face, in making effective use of an OLM for reflection. 1. We created a tutorial to scaffold sense-making needed to understand the meaning of the OLM. 2. We integrated an interface scaffold to help users consider key questions for effective reflection. We report the results of a qualitative think-aloud lab study with 21 participants viewing their own long term OLM. To evaluate the tutorial scaffolding, we split participants into an experimental group, who did a tutorial before exploring the OLM and a control group which explored the interface without the tutorial. To evaluate the reflection scaffolding, all participants first explored the interface as they wished. We then provided goal prompts to scaffold reflection. Our study revealed that, under lab conditions, the tutorial scaffolding was not needed - all participants in both groups could readily understand the OLM. However, we found that several of the goal prompts were important to help participants consider key questions for effective reflection. Our key contribution is insights into the design of scaffolding for reflection in a life-long learning context of gaining insights and setting goals for physical activity.</p></div> </div> <h2>SESSION: Personalized Social Web I</h2> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList Last">Marco de Gemmis</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653192" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Predicting Users' Personality from Instagram Pictures: Using Visual and/or Content Features?</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Bruce Ferwerda</li> <li class="nameList Last">Marko Tkalcic</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Instagram is a popular social networking application that allows users to express themselves through the uploaded content and the different filters they can apply.

To do this, they must adapt and embody the essence of social and emotional intelligence. This not only includes the ability to recognise human emotions and social interactions but also understand them, deliberate them and act accordingly. Lately, significant research has been carried out in an attempt to find ways to build social and emotional robots that are able to perceive the user's emotions, adapt to them, and react appropriately. This talk will, therefore, provide an overview of the area of emotions in social interactions established between humans and social robots.

To remedy this, we present a new methodology for the measurement of choice satisfaction. Part of our approach is to measure a user's "ease of satisfaction," or that user's natural propensity to be satisfied, which is measured using three different approaches. An (N=526) observational study is conducted wherein users browse a movie catalog. A factor analysis is done to assess the discriminant validity of our proposed choice satisfaction apparatus from user experience. A statistical analysis suggests that accounting for ease-of-satisfaction allows for a model of choice satisfaction that is not only discriminant, but independent, from user experience.

In current recommender systems, explanation is a step that comes after recommendation. In this paper, we describe an approach that turns recommender systems on their head. In our approach, which we call <i>Recommendation-by-Explanation</i> (<i>hr-by-e</i> ), the system constructs a reason, or explanation, for recommending each candidate item; then it recommends those candidate items that have the best explanations. By unifying recommendation and explanation, <i>r-by-e</i> finds relevant recommendations with explanations that have a high degree of fidelity. We present the results of an offline experiment using a movie recommendation dataset. We show that <i>r-by-e</i> achieves higher precision than a comparable recommender, while both produce recommendations with roughly equal levels of diversity and serendipity. We also present the results of deploying a web-based system through which we have conducted two user trials. In one trial, we evaluate recommendation quality. Participants in this trial found <i>r-by-e</i>'s recommendations to be more diverse, serendipitous and relevant than those of the competitor system. In another trial, we evaluate explanation quality. We used a re-rating task: users rated recommendations initially in the case where they were given only the explanation and not the identity of the movie, and then re-rated in the case where they were given information about the recommended movie. We found a stronger correlation between the pairs of ratings in the case of <i>r-by-e.</i> This suggests that <i>r-by-e</i>'s explanations allow users to make more accurate judgments about the quality of recommended items.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653108" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Multi-Modal Adversarial Autoencoders for Recommendations of Citations and Subject Labels</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Lukas Galke</li> <li class="nameList">Florian Mai</li> <li class="nameList">Iacopo Vagliano</li> <li class="nameList Last">Ansgar Scherp</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>We present multi-modal adversarial autoencoders for recommendation and evaluate them on two different tasks: citation recommendation and subject label recommendation.

This raises the problem of personalized dataset recommendations for users unfamiliar with the repository or not able to clearly articulate their information needs. To this end, we present and evaluate in this paper a recommendation approach applied to a new task --- recommending research datasets.

In this paper we look at the exposure of individual items to different groups of consumers, the item's audience, and address the question of whether recommender systems reach each item's potential audience. Thus, we go beyond state-of-the-art analyses that have simply addressed the extent to which items are recommended, regardless of whether they are reaching their target audience.

Research has shown that personalizing these strategies makes them more effective in achieving the desired behavior change among users.

Therefore, we propose a personalized content recommendation framework to extrapolate topical navigation graphs from learners' free navigation and integrate them with fuzzy thesauri for automatic and adaptive personalized content recommendations to support informal learning in wikis.</p></div> </div> <h2>SESSION: Keynote Address III</h2> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList Last">Li Chen</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653111" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Interpreting User Input Intention in Natural Human Computer Interaction</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList Last">Yuanchun Shi</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Human Computer Interaction (HCI)1 is about information exchange between human and computers. Interaction between users and computers occurs at the User Interface (UI). Now, computers become pervasive, they are embedded in everyday things and UIs are the main value-added competitive advantages. UIs should be more natural for users. NUI (natural user interface) expands forms beyond formal input devices like the mouse and keyboard to more and more natural forms of interaction such as touch, speech, gestures, handwriting, and vision. Unlike speech, handwriting and vision, which have been researched for decades and put into practical use recently, touch and gestures are interaction tasks related, and yet lack of study. This talk will introduce methods of modelling user input action based on data with the random noise for fast touch input and natural gestures.</p></div> </div> <h2>SESSION: Personalized Recommender Systems IV &#38; Intelligent User Interfaces</h2> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList Last">Robin Burke</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653112" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Investigating the Decision-Making Behavior of Maximizers and Satisficers in the Presence of Recommendations</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Michael Jugovac</li> <li class="nameList">Ingrid Nunes</li> <li class="nameList Last">Dietmar Jannach</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Psychological theory distinguishes between maximizing and satisficing decision-making styles. Maximizers tend to explore more or all alternatives when making a choice, while satisficers evaluate options until they find one that is good enough. There is limited research that examines how the existence of a recommender influences the choice process and decisions of different types of decision-makers. We report the results of a controlled study, in which we monitored the choice process of participants when provided with automated recommendations and different types of additional information regarding available options. Our analyses show that none of the differences that were expected based on the literature manifested itself in the experiment. Maximizers neither inspected more items, nor invested more time to study them. Instead, like satisficers, they mostly picked one of the top-ranked items recommended by the system, which emphasizes the value of recommenders in particular for maximizers, who would otherwise face a more challenging decision problem. The analysis of the preferences of participants over different types of additional information revealed that highlighting key pros and cons was perceived as particularly helpful for the maximizers, an insight that can be used for the design of explanation approaches for recommenders.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653113" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Trust in Recommender Systems</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Shlomo Berkovsky</li> <li class="nameList">Ronnie Taib</li> <li class="nameList">Yoshinori Hijikata</li> <li class="nameList">Pavel Braslavsku</li> <li class="nameList Last">Bart Knijnenburg</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>User system trust is critical to the uptake of recommendations, and several factors of trust have been identified and compared.

To mitigate this issue, diversity-enhanced user interfaces for recommender systems have in the past found to be effective in increasing overall user satisfaction with recommendations. However, users may have different requirements for diversity, and consequently different visualization requirements. In this paper, we evaluate two visual user interfaces, SimBub and ComBub, to present the diversity of a music recommender system from different perspectives. SimBub is a baseline bubble chart that shows music genres and popularity by color and size, respectively. In addition, ComBub visualizes selected audio features along the X and Y axis in a more advanced and complex visualization. Our goal is to investigate how individual traits such as musical sophistication (MS) and visual memory (VM) influence the satisfaction of the visualization for perceived music diversity, overall usability, and support to identify blind-spots. We hypothesize that music experts, or people with better visual memory, will perceive higher diversity in ComBub than SimBub. A within-subjects user study (N=83) is conducted to compare these two visualizations. Results of our study show that participants with high MS and VM tend to perceive significantly higher diversity from ComBub compared to SimBub. In contrast, participants with low MS perceived significantly higher diversity from SimBub than ComBub; however, no significant result is found for the participants with low VM. Our research findings show the necessity of considering individual traits while designing diversity-aware interfaces.</p></div> </div> <h2>SESSION: Personalized Social Web II</h2> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList Last">Nava Tintarev</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653125" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Who is Your Best Friend?: Ranking Social Network Friends According to Trust Relationship</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Xiaoming Li</li> <li class="nameList">Hui Fang</li> <li class="nameList">Qing Yang</li> <li class="nameList Last">Jie Zhang</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>In online social networks (OSNs), e.g. Facebook, the relationship between users is binary, i.e., either friend (trust) or stranger (distrust).

This paper aims to fill this gap by analyzing the dynamics of news on Twitter, by revealing what drives users to consume news, and by developing a news consumption prediction model. We present the Twitter News Model (TNM), a computational data-driven approach to elucidate the dynamics of news consumption on Twitter. We apply the TNM to a dataset of interactions between users and journalists/newspapers to reveal what drives users' consumption of news on Twitter, and predictively relate users' news beliefs, motivations, and attitudes to their consumption of news.

In this study, we were able to infer attributes, such as gender, age, marital status, and whether the user has children, using solely the GPS sensor. We suggest a novel inference technique, which learns an embedding representation of preprocessed spatial GPS trajectories using an adaption of the Word2vec approach. Based on the embedding representation, we later train multiple classification models to achieve the inference goals. Our empirical results indicate that the suggested embedding approach outperforms a classification approach which does not take into consideration the embedding patterns.

Oftentimes, these models, the processes, and evidences are hidden from the learners and even teachers. Open learner models (OLM) are intended to make the underlying logic of a model as well as the evidences that contributed to a certain student appraisal transparent to its users. Furthermore, they are intended to support learning in a formative sense, aiming to help learners to self-monitor, plan, focus, and work independently as well as to communicate and negotiate appraisals with peers and teachers. We present a use case where Lea's OLM uses evidence from a speed-reading training application, to build the model. Learners use a persuasion function to interact with the system and maintain the OLM. The study showed that students are able to use it efficiently in order to make their model more accurate. We argue that persuasion, and other interactive maintenance features, are a strong approach to improve a transparent and accurate learner modelling, specifically when the underlying evidences are manifold and from multiple, partially unclear sources.

We describe the musical preferences of users by relying on the acoustic features of the songs the users have been listening to and characterize the cultural background of users by cultural and socio-economic features that we infer from the user's country. To evaluate the impact of the proposed user model on recommendation quality, we integrate the model into a culture-aware music recommender system.

Unfortunately, since sequences are more complex to model, they are often not taken into account. We developed an efficient sequence-modeling approach based on Bayesian Variable-order Markov Models and combined it with an existing content-based system, the Ontology Filtering.
