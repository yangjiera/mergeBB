As a result, users are often unaware of opposing points of view, leading to informational blindspots and potentially polarized opinions. They may be aware of a topic, but only be exposed to one viewpoint on this topic. However, recommender systems have just as much potential to help users find a plurality of viewpoints. In this spirit, this paper introduces an approach to automatically identifying content that represents a wider range of opinions on a given topic. Our offline results show positive results for our distance measure with regard to diversification on topic and channel. However, our user study results confirm that user acceptance of this diversification also needs to be addressed in tandem to enable a complete solution.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653208" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Compliance of Personalized Radio with Public-Service Remits</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Stefan Hirschmeier</li> <li class="nameList Last">Vanessa Beule</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Public radio broadcasters do not consider personalization in their compliance with their public-service remit so far. However, personalization brings along the risk of filter bubbles, which contradicts with the ideas of the public-service remit. We shed light on the interconnection of personalization and the public-service remit of broadcasters anchored in an analysis of the interstate treaty on broadcasting and tele-media. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we propose an approach how to selectively avoid filter bubbles in personalized radio consumption. Second, we develop a framework that helps to assess the compliance of personalized radio offers with public-service remits.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653209" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Using Image Fairness Representations in Diversity-Based Re-ranking for Recommendations</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Chen Karako</li> <li class="nameList Last">Putra Manggala</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>The trade-off between relevance and fairness in personalized recommendations has been explored in recent works, with the goal of minimizing learned discrimination towards certain demographics while still producing relevant results. We present a fairness-aware variation of the Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) re-ranking method which uses representations of demographic groups computed using a labeled dataset. This method is intended to incorporate fairness with respect to these demographic groups. We perform an experiment on a stock photo dataset and examine the trade-off between relevance and fairness against a well known baseline, MMR, by using human judgment to examine the results of the re-ranking when using different fractions of a labeled dataset, and by performing a quantitative analysis on the ranked results of a set of query images. We show that our proposed method can incorporate fairness in the ranked results while obtaining higher precision than the baseline, while our case study shows that even a limited amount of labeled data can be used to compute the representations to obtain fairness. This method can be used as a post-processing step for recommender systems and search.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653200" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Fairness In Reciprocal Recommendations: A Speed-Dating Study</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Yong Zheng</li> <li class="nameList">Tanaya Dave</li> <li class="nameList">Neha Mishra</li> <li class="nameList Last">Harshit Kumar</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Traditional recommender systems suggest items by learning from user preferences, but ignore other stakeholders in the whole system. Actually, not only the receiver of the recommendations, but also other stakeholders may come into play, such as the producers of items or those of the system owners. Reciprocal recommender system in dating or job recommendations is one of these examples. However, we may have to simulate the utilities for each type of the stakeholder due to the utility definitions. In this paper, we perform exploratory analysis on a speed-dating data, where the user expectations are clearly defined. We try to build a multi-dimensional utility framework by utilizing multi-criteria ratings. We further analyze the relationship between the utilities and recommendation performance, and achieve a tradeoff as the optimal solution. Even more, the proposed approach is able to outperform the exiting reciprocal recommendation algorithms in precision, recall and overall utilities. Finally, we derive a promising way to define and optimize utilities to be generalized in other applications or domains.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653201" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Diversity Checker: Toward Recommendations for Improving Journalism with Respect to Diversity</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Jeroen Peperkamp</li> <li class="nameList Last">Bettina Berendt</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>The Diversity Checker is a tool that aims to make it easier for journalists to author their texts with diversity in mind.

HAAPIE 2018 (http://haapie.cs.ucy.ac.cy) is a full-day workshop held on 08 July 2018 in conjunction with the 26th ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP 2018), 08-11 July 2018 in Singapore. Nowadays, the profound digital transformation has upgraded the role of the computational system into an intelligent multidimensional communication medium that creates new opportunities, competencies, models and processes. HAAPIE embraces the essence of the human-machine co-existence and aims to bring more inclusively the "human-in-the-loop" approach/idea, adequately supporting the rising multi-purpose goals, needs, requirements, activities and interactions of users through new human-centered adaptive and personalized interactive environments, algorithms and systems. It brings together experts, researchers, students and practitioners from different disciplines in order to share ideas and experiences, lessons learned, approaches and results that could substantially contribute to the broader UMAP community.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653203" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Your Digital News Reading Habits Reflect Your Personality</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Marios Constantinides</li> <li class="nameList">Panagiotis Germanakos</li> <li class="nameList">George Samaras</li> <li class="nameList Last">John Dowell</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>The way people read digital news - as distinct from what news they read - has emerged as a significant concern for research in user modelling and personalisation. Intuitively, some people read the news frequently and broadly whilst others read it occasionally and selectively. It is likely that these differences in news reading behaviour arise in part from differences in peoples' personalities. We report a study that surveyed the digital news reading habits and personality traits of 241 people. We find correlations between most news reading characteristics (e.g., how much time over a day a person reads news) and some personality traits (e.g Openness-to-Experience). The correlations provide a better understanding of the different types of news reading user and why they read news in different ways. They indicate the value of extending user model profiles to include personality traits along with domain specific activity factors.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653204" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Exploring User Roles In Group Recommendations: A Learning Approach</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList Last">Yong Zheng</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Personality, as one of the human factors, has been demonstrated as an influential factor in decision making. Particularly, personality traits can be utilized to identify decision leaders and followers in the context of group decision making. In this paper, we propose an approach to learn user roles (i.e., decision leaders and followers) to improve the performance of group recommendations. More specifically, we utilize the binary particle swarm optimization as the method to assign and learn user roles in each group. Our experimental results based on an educational data reveal that the proposed approach is able to improve group recommendations. However, the learned user roles may not present expected characteristics in terms of the personality traits.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653215" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Towards a Fuzzy Rule-based Systems Approach for Adaptive Interventions in Menopause Self-care</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Amaury Trujillo</li> <li class="nameList Last">Maria Claudia Buzzi</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>We present a novel approach in the design of self-care applications aimed at women in pre-menopause and menopause, which is based on the use fuzzy rule-based systems (FRBS) for the description of women's health status, behavior, and personality traits, as well as the provision of adaptive interventions. Our main goal is to develop a personalized solution that informs users and promotes healthy behavioral changes in them, as many women are not conscious of the health consequences caused by menopause. To this end, we follow just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), a design framework for the rule-based provision of personalized and on-demand interventions through mobile applications, according to user's health status and behavior. However, these health-related concepts are usually vague and difficult to formalize in a well-constrained manner. Therefore, to overcome these issues, our approach seeks to leverage the knowledge of health professional experts and the capacity of fuzzy logic modelling and inference to formally define such vague concepts and rules. Although we discuss this approach in the context of menopause self-care, in which prior user data may be insufficient for alternative techniques, it could also be applied in other self-care applications facing similar challenges.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653216" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Equilibrium State of Interaction: Maximizing User Experience through Optimum Adaptivity States</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Panagiotis Germanakos</li> <li class="nameList">Panayiotis Andreou</li> <li class="nameList Last">Constantinos Mourlas</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Nowadays, the role of the computer and the Internet has been upgraded in the lives of people, witnessing a paradigm shift on how users communicate with each other or with their service providers. Main characteristics of this reality include dynamic strategies and conditions, multivariate random interactions with instant feedback, and holistic activities with no clear origins across mixed realities. Thereupon, it seems that traditional human-computer interaction methods and adaptivity practices lack the appropriate dynamicity to fully address these aspects and to explicitly offer holistic solutions for enhancing user experience. In this paper, we propose an alternative model and formalization by combining concepts like equilibria and refocusing the core of investigation into the actual single objective interactions that are generated by the interplay of two (or more) participatory ends over a time interval and which cannot be recognized a priori. The resulting interactions consist of dynamic suboptimal adaptivity states of the two that provide an Equilibrium State of Interaction and a motivational engagement.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653217" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Self-Regulation, Knowledge, Experience: Which User Characteristics are Useful for Predicting Video Engagement?</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Alicja Piotrkowicz</li> <li class="nameList">Vania Dimitrova</li> <li class="nameList">Antonija Mitrovic</li> <li class="nameList Last">Lydia Lau</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>The use of videos in education has attracted considerable research attention. However, in order to gain the most benefits, learners need to actively engage with videos. It is an important, yet challenging, task to disentangle the relation between engagement with videos and learning, and at the same time to take into account relevant individual differences in order to offer personalised support. In this paper we investigate the question: "Can user characteristics relating to self-regulation, knowledge, and experience be leveraged for predicting user engagement with videos?". Our results show that users' domain knowledge and self-regulation abilities can inform overall engagement prediction (inactive, passive and constructive learners), which makes them useful for adaptation and personalisation.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653218" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Towards Modelling the User Creative Process in a Sandbox Game</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Styliani Kleanthous</li> <li class="nameList">Demetris Christodoulou</li> <li class="nameList">George A.

The PAs (Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Now, Microsoft Cortana etc.) help us to set reminders, find our way through traffic, or send messages to friends and colleagues. While being always available to serve our needs, they collect our personal data to improve their Services and tune their behavior. In order to find out which features (e.g., proactivity, storing of data) are accepted or even desired by potential users to model an adaptive PA with respective spoken output, we conducted an online survey with 1,051 German speaking and 499 US participants. We compared the participants' information on their interaction with different systems, including in-vehicle Spoken Dialog Systems (SDSs), smartphone voice control, and smart home devices (e.g., Amazon Echo, Google Home). We had a look both into output features of spoken dialog by showing dialog examples, as well as posing direct questions on potential system features and its interaction behavior. The results show that especially proactivity is desired by the participants while none of the participants has a positive attitude towards the systems' data usage when asked explicitly.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653210" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">User Modelling in Exergames for Frail Older Adults</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Zelai S&#225;enz-de-Urturi</li> <li class="nameList Last">Olga C.

According to a recent claim by IBM, 90% of the data available today have been created in the last two years. This exponential growth of online information has given new life to research in the area of user modeling and personalization, since information about users' preferences, sentiment and opinions, as well as signals describing their physical and psychological state, can now be obtained by mining data gathered from many heterogeneous sources. We can distinguish two important classes of such data sources. One of these comes from recent trends in Quantified Self (QS) and Personal Informatics, which has emphasized the use of technology to collect personal data on different aspects of people's daily lives. These data can be internal states (such as mood or glucose level) or indicators of performance (such as the kilometers run). The purpose of collecting these data is self-monitoring, performed to gain self-knowledge or to obtain some change or improvement (behavioral, psychological, therapeutic, etc.). Often these data are also exploited for behavior change purposes, for example to increase the user's physical activity. The other key category comes from the enormous amount of textual content that is continuously spread on social networks. This has driven a strong research effort to investigate to what extent such data can be exploited to infer user interests, personality traits, emotions, and knowledge. Moreover, the recent phenomenon of (Linked) Open Data fueled this research line by making available a huge amount of machine-readable textual data that can be used to connect all the data points spread in different data silos under a uniform representation formalism. The main goal of the workshop is to investigate whether techniques for advanced content representation and methodologies for gathering and modeling personal data (e.g. physiological, behavioral) can be exploited to build a new generation of personalized and intelligent systems in domains as diverse as health, learning, behavior change, e-government, smart cities (e.g., by combining mood data and music preferences data to provide recommendations on music to be listened).</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653212" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Tourist Support System Using User Context Obtained from a Personal Information Device</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Shogo Matsuno</li> <li class="nameList">Reiji Suzumura</li> <li class="nameList Last">Minoru Ohyama</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Tour planning is a difficult task for those who visit unfamiliar city destinations.

Our holistic user model is based on the insight that each person can be described through different facets, such as her interests, activities, habits, mood, social connections and so on, and each facet can be modeled by gathering and merging information coming from diverse sources. To this end, we designed a platform that automatically acquires personal data coming from both social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook, as well as devices, such as Android smartphones and FitBit wristbands. Next, these rough data are merged, processed and enriched in order to infer high-level features (e.g., user interested in technology, user experiencing a bad mood, sedentary person, and so on) or to extract user behavioral patterns (e.g., places that are frequently visited). Such unique representation of a person, whose strength is the combination of different heterogeneous data points, is finally encoded and stored in our platform and can be made available to both the user itself and to third-party services. In the former case, data are shown through a visual interface. In the latter, holistic user profiles are exposed through this unique entry point and external applications can build new personalized services based on the digital footprints spread by the user.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653214" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">iSynchronizer: A Tool for Extracting, Integration and Analysis of MovieLens and IMDb Datasets</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Nourah A.

For this purpose, variety of applications and resources such as MovieLens and IMDb datasets have been utilized, which present a rich database of items (movies), their attributes and ratings. It is a common practice to utilize both MovieLens and IMDb datasets to produce richer dataset about items and user-generated information such as tags and ratings for conducting research in recommender systems domain. Moreover, the combined dataset contains contextual feature represented by timestamps. However, dealing with a big chunk of the IMDb dataset and its integration with MovieLens dataset remains a challenge due to the various issues such as resource constraints and broken links. To address these issues, a more complex procedure has to be adopted for the integration of both datasets. Hence, this paper introduces iSynchronizer, which is an open-source tool for synchronizing MovieLens and IMDb datasets autonomously with minimum effort. Moreover, the tool includes code to generate a matrix of item features and user preferences over item features from the raw integrated dataset.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653225" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Holistic User Models for Cognitive Disabilities: Personalized Tools for Supporting People with Autism in the City</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Amon Rapp</li> <li class="nameList">Federica Cena</li> <li class="nameList">Claudio Mattutino</li> <li class="nameList">Alessia Calafiore</li> <li class="nameList">Claudio Schifanella</li> <li class="nameList">Elena Grassi</li> <li class="nameList Last">Guido Boella</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>This paper presents a personalized interactive map aimed at supporting people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in their daily transfers within urban environments.

The semantic embeddings generated from heterogeneous knowledge sources combined with user preferences can be used to refine a user's information needs. This representation modeling of users, entities and their associated properties opens up new modalities of interactions for the users to gravitate towards their requirements.

This problem is magnified in the case of cold start setting - resulting in users being restricted to popular set of items and can result in a "rich getting richer eco-system". As a result, in recent years, more attention is being paid to improving the diversity of recommender system results. List creation has become a popular way for users to express preferences over items on online platforms such as imdb.com and goodreads.com. These user curated lists tend to contain a coherent semantic representation of the domain the list of items belong to. List curation can be seen as a way to capture fine grained topic-specific item-lists by users. Understanding and modeling user preferences expressed in these curated lists can help with diverse set of applications such as recommendations, user modeling, session understanding etc. In this paper, we propose an approach to improve the diversity of results generated by Top-N recommender systems, by using Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) over user curated lists in the movie domain and incorporating them to rerank the Top-N recommender systems. For this work, we use the user curated lists in the imdb.com domain. We evaluate our approach over the Movielens 1-Million dataset and compare the results with other baseline approaches. Our early results show that incorporating semantic similarity expressed in user lists as a diversity proxy results in a more diverse set of recommendations.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653229" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Predicting Learning Difficulty Based on Gaze and Pupil Response</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Saurin Parikh</li> <li class="nameList Last">Hari Kalva</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>E-Learning is transforming the way education is imparted. Today, millions of students take self-paced online courses. However, the content and language complexity often hinders comprehension and this together with lack of immediate help from the course instructor leads to weak learning outcomes. Ability to predict difficult content in real time enables eLearning systems to adapt content as per students' level of learning. The recent introduction of low-cost eye trackers has opened the new class of applications based on eye response. Eye tracking devices can record eye response to the visual element or concept causing a learning difficulty. The response and the variations in eye response to the same concept over time may be indicative of the level of learning. In this paper, we use eye movement measures to predict the levels of learning associated with a term/concept. The main contribution of this study is the spatio-temporal analysis of eye response to a term/concept. Proposed system analyses slide images, extracts words (terms), maps the eye response to words, and prepares a term-response map. A majority voting classifier trained with terms of known learning levels uses this term response map to classify a term as novel or familiar. The proposed system achieves 61% accuracy when predicting learning difficulty.</p></div> </div> <h2>SESSION: IUadaptMe Workshop</h2> <div class="DLabstract"> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653220" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">UMAP 2018 Intelligent User-Adapted Interfaces: Design and Multi-Modal Evaluation (IUadaptMe) Workshop Chairs' Welcome &#38;Organization</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Ilknur Celik</li> <li class="nameList">Ilaria Torre</li> <li class="nameList">Frosina Koceva</li> <li class="nameList">Christine Bauer</li> <li class="nameList">Eva Zangerle</li> <li class="nameList Last">Bart Knijnenburg</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653221" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Adaptive User Interface for a Personalized Mobile Banking App: Extended Abstract</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Mohammad Nawaz</li> <li class="nameList">Luvai Motiwalla</li> <li class="nameList Last">Amit V.

In this paper, we address next-place prediction using the sequential and temporal patterns embedded in human mobility data that has been collected using the GPS sensor of smartphones. We test five next-place prediction methods, including single pattern-based methods and hybrid methods that combine temporal and sequential patterns. Instead of only examining average accuracy as in related work, we additionally evaluate the selected methods using incremental-prediction accuracy on two publicly available datasets (the MDC dataset and the StudentLife dataset). Our results suggest that (1) integrating multiple patterns is not necessarily more effective than using single patterns in average prediction accuracy, (2) most of the tested methods can outperform others for a certain time period (either for the prediction of all places or each place individually), and (3) average prediction accuracies of the top-three candidates using sequential patterns are relatively high (up to 0.77 and 0.91 in the median for both datasets). For real-time applications, we recommend applying multiple methods in parallel and choosing the prediction of the best method according to incremental-prediction accuracy.

They can also lead to outright rejection of the recommended items. One way to avoid this is to explain recommendations that are surprising, or even expected to be disliked, by an individual user. This paper presents an approach for generating explanations for groups. We propose algorithms for selecting a sequence of songs for a group to consume. These algorithms consider consensus but have different trade-offs. Next, using these algorithms we generated explanations in a layered evaluation using synthetic data. We studied the influence of these explanations in structured interviews with users (n=16) on user satisfaction.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653243" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Photos Don't Have Me, But How Do You Know Me?: Analyzing and Predicting Users on Instagram</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Kyungsik Han</li> <li class="nameList">Yonggeol Jo</li> <li class="nameList">Youngseung Jeon</li> <li class="nameList">Bogoan Kim</li> <li class="nameList">Junho Song</li> <li class="nameList Last">Sang-Wook Kim</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>This paper presents a comprehensive analysis on social media use and engagement by age and gender on Instagram.

The users can also review the locations they have visited. Classical recommender systems provide users a ranked list of single items. This is not suitable for applications like trip planning,where the recommendations should contain multiple items in an appropriate sequence. The problem of generating such recommendations is challenging due to various critical aspects, which includes user interest, budget constraints and high sparsity in the available data used to solve the problem. In this paper, we propose a graph based approach to recommend a set of personalized travel packages. Each recommended package comprises of a sequence of multiple Point of Interests (POIs). Given the current location and spatio-temporal constraints, our goal is to recommend a package which satisfies the constraints.

Attempts have been made to objectively define what comprises a successful collaboration. Questions like "When can we say that a collaboration is successful?" or "Is there a way to predict that a collaboration would be successful?" have been asked. In this paper, we look at the output of the collaboration, which are the debugging scores of the pairs, and we consider a collaboration to be successful if it leads to good debugging scores. We choose pair programming because it is an example of a collaboration paradigm. In order to find out what are the potential factors that could possibly predict success in the context of a pair program tracing and debugging task, we performed a dual eye tracking experiment on pairs of novice programmers. We tracked and recorded their fixation sequences and analyzed them using Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA). Two machine learning algorithms were used, such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. Our findings reveal that CRQA results alone are inadequate to come up with a model with an acceptable performance. Hence, we added the pairs' proficiency level to the model. Between the two models, the Logistic Regression model turned out to be the better model. However, the performance is still not quite unacceptable to predict success so other features are needed to enhance the model.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653356" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Adaptive Problem Selection in a Mobile Python Tutor</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Geela Venise Firmalo Fabic</li> <li class="nameList">Antonija Mitrovic</li> <li class="nameList Last">Kourosh Neshatian</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>We have developed PyKinetic, a mobile Python tutor for novices.

Yet, placing multiple users in a shared environment may increase the risk of interferences, thus causing mental discomfort and decreasing efficiency of the team. To mitigate interferences coordination strategies and techniques were introduced. However, in a mixed-focus collaboration scenarios users switch now and again between loosely and tightly collaboration, therefore different coordination techniques might be required depending on the current collaboration state of team members. For that, systems have to be able to recognize collaboration states as well as transitions between them to ensure a proper adjustment of the coordination strategy. Previous studies on group behavior during collaboration in front of large displays investigated solely collaborative coupling states, not transitions between them though. To address this gap, we conducted a study with 12 participant dyads in front of a tiled display and let them solve two tasks in two different conditions (focus and overview). We looked into group dynamics and categorized transitions by means of changes in proximity, verbal communication, visual attention, visual interface, and gestures.

We propose a framework based on Toulmin's model designed to generate explanations in an argumentative style by presenting supportive as well as critical information about recommended items and their features. Existing research suggests that argumentative explanations cannot be assumed as equally effective for everyone. People rather tend to either apply rational or intuitive decision-making styles that determine which kinds of information are preferably taken into account. In an experimental user study, we investigated the effectiveness of argumentative explanations while considering the moderating effect of these two different cognitive styles. The results indicate that argumentative explanations, as compared to baseline methods, lead to, among others, increased perceived explanation quality, information sufficiency and overall satisfaction with the system. However, this seems only to be true for intuitive thinkers who rely more on explanations in complex decision situations as compared to rational thinkers.</p></div> </div> <h3> <a class="DLtitleLink" href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N653351" title="Get the Full Text from the ACM Digital Library">Stationary vs. Non-stationary Mobile Learning in MOOCs</a> </h3> <ul class="DLauthors"> <li class="nameList First">Yue Zhao</li> <li class="nameList">Tarmo Robal</li> <li class="nameList">Christoph Lofi</li> <li class="nameList Last">Claudia Hauff</li> </ul> <div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline"><p>Mobile devices enable users to access information ubiquitously, including in the online learning scenario.

Group Polarization is the tendency of a group to make decisions that are more extreme than the average of individual group members' preferences. We analyze Group Polarization in the context of risk analysis and cost estimation. In risk related group decisions, we figured out that if individual group members tend to make cautious decisions, then the group decision will be more cautious. However, in decisions related to cost estimation, the group estimations are lower than the average of group members' estimations (i.e., cautious shift). Furthermore, our results show that individual group members with diverse preferences are not influenced by Group Polarization Effects.
